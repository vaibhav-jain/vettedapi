A simple Django starter template

## Setup Instructions ##
1. Make sure you have Django-1.9 installed on your system
2. Create your new Django project by running this command

  `django-admin.py startproject mynewproject --template=https://github.com/kaizentech/skeleton/archive/master.zip`

3. Install requirements by running this command from your project dir

  On Prod:

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

  On Dev:

4. Setup these environment variables on your system (or in virtualenv)


On Windows

```
  set "DEBUG=True"
  set "DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.dev"
  set "SECRET_KEY=xxxxxYourxxSecretxxKeyxxxxx"
  set "DATABASE_URL=psql://username:password@127.0.0.1:5432/dbname"
```

You can also save these in your virtualenv's script for auto invocation during virtualenv initialization
